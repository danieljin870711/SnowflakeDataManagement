# SnowflakeDataManagement
Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse that can store and analyze all your data records in one place. 
It can automatically scale up/down its compute resources to load, integrate, and analyze data. In this project, I used Snowflake to illustrate how to performe the following activities such as 
loading structured and unstructured data, performance optimization, zero copy cloning, data sharing, data sampling, materilized views, and data masking.
